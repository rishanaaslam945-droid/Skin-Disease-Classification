Skin-Disease-Classification
Skin Disease Classification using CNN and Streamlit

📌 Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based system that classifies different types of skin diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The system allows users to upload a skin image and predicts the disease category using a trained model.

🚀 Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Streamlit

 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains dermatoscopic images of different skin diseases used for training and testing the CNN model.

⚙️ Methodology

1. Data preprocessing (image resizing and normalization)
2. Splitting dataset into training and testing
3. Training CNN model
4. Saving trained model (.h5 file)
5. Building Streamlit web application for prediction

 ▶️ How to Run

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:
streamlit run app.py


 📊 Results

The model successfully classifies skin diseases with good accuracy.

 🔮 Future Improvements

* Use larger datasets
* Improve accuracy with advanced architectures
* Deploy as a mobile or web application
